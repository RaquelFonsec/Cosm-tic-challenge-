Film Data Analysis Project for PProductions

Project Description

In this project, we will conduct a detailed analysis of film data from PProductions. The challenge involves exploring relationships between different variables and developing predictive models to guide the company's decision on the next type of film to produce. We will utilize techniques in data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical interpretation to provide valuable insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During exploratory data analysis, we identified significant trends and patterns in the film data. We highlighted key features among variables and explored potential relationships. For more details, please refer to the Exploratory Data Analysis report in the provided notebook.

Visualization

To visualize PDF files directly in Visual Studio Code, we recommend using the "PDF Viewer" extension available in the VS Code extension marketplace.
